ReferrerCop Changelog
---------------------

Version 2.0.0 (?):
  * Relicensed under the New BSD License.
  * Significant behind-the-scenes architectural changes resulting in some big
    performance improvements.

Version 1.1.0 (02/26/2006):
  * The format of blacklists and whitelists has changed; regular expressions
    must now be enclosed in forward slashes (i.e., /regexp/). All other list
    entries will be treated as plain strings.
  * The standard blacklist is now the default, rather than the regexp-heavy
    optimized blacklist. We were getting a little too close to Ruby's regexp
    memory limit with the optimized list.
  * Performance with large lists has been greatly improved; ReferrerCop is now
    capable of handling blacklists and whitelists of 100,000 entries or more
    without problems.
  * The blacklist update feature has been revised to use SHA1 checksums rather
    than timestamps to determine whether the remote blacklist and the local
    blacklist are out of sync.
  * Many common options can now be specified in a configuration file.

Version 1.0.4 (10/17/2005):
  * Added -U mode to check for an updated default blacklist and download it if
    available.
  * Fixed a bug that caused an extra newline to be inserted into AWStats data
    files when no referrer URLs were present.

Version 1.0.3 (10/06/2005):
  * Added -i mode for in-place filtering of files.
  * Minor performance optimizations.
  * Improved parsing of AWStats data files.
  * Fixed a bug that would occasionally result in an extra newline being
    inserted into filtered AWStats data files.

Version 1.0.2 (06/17/2005):
  * Over 300% faster than previous versions due to a new heavily optimized
    blacklist and various other improvements.
  * Added -n and -s modes to extract ham and spam URLs, respectively.
  * Removed -B and -W modes (the optimized blacklist makes them useless).
  * Renamed -v option to -V.
  * Renamed -d option to -v (for "verbose").
  * Improved error handling.
  * Refactored and greatly improved module API (for developers who want to use
    ReferrerCop's functionality in their own Ruby applications).

Version 1.0.1 (06/09/2005):
  * Filter all files passed on the command line (wildcards supported), or
    standard input if no files are specified.
  * If input isn't an Apache combined log or AWStats data file, assume that
    it's a list of URLs and attempt to filter them.
  * Added -d option to display debugging output and statistics.
  * Added -u mode to display the ham/spam status of a single URL passed on the
    command line.
  * Added -B and -W modes to provide respective blacklist and whitelist pattern
    counts.
  * Don't panic on malformed/corrupted lines in Apache logs.
  * Display less cryptic error messages when invalid command-line options are
    entered.

Version 1.0.0 (06/04/2005):
  * First public release.
